# QuantumBot
QuantumBot is a unique simulation of bots controlled by a quantum neural network. Using Qiskit for quantum computations, PyTorch for neural networks, and Tkinter for the GUI, it showcases the intersection of quantum computing and AI in a simple, visual way.



bot-communication-beta.p√ø is a beta script for testing bot communication on top of the normal bot structure
